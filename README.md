# simpLi creating an amaZhang Stegsolve!
This is an amazing name!

## Description
Stegsolve but cooler! That's all you need to know...

But in all seriousness it is just Stegsolve, but with the ability to alter the bit plane yourself!

## Directions
Simply download the repository, and either:
- Putting an image into the repository and then running the makefile as such:
  
  ```make run ARGS="[INSERT_FILE_NAME_HERE]"```
  
  It might be necessary to run the processing file manually if ```processing...``` doesn't work on the computer (it should in the lab computers).
  
  **OR**
  
- Putting the image file into the Stegjar folder, saved as "stegosaurus.png" and running the processing file normally.
